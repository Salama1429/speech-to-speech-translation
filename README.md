## Description

This repository demonstrates cascaded speech-to-speech translation (STST), which involves mapping source speech in any language to target speech in German. The demo utilizes the following models:

- [Whisper Base](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base): OpenAI's model for speech translation
- [My German TTS](https://huggingface.co/Salama1429/TTS_German_Speecht5_finetuned_voxpopuli_nl): My text-to-speech model for generating German speech

## How It Works

The cascaded STST process involves two steps:

1. **Speech Translation (Source Language to German Text):** The Whisper Base model translates source speech in any language into German text.

2. **Text-to-Speech (German Text to Target Speech):** The German text generated by Whisper Base is then input to the My German TTS model to produce the final target speech in German.

## Usage

You can use it directly from my huggingface space
